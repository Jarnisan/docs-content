## Connecting to the Board

Once the Portenta X8 is plugged in via USB, you can open your browser and go to http://192.168.7.1 and see a web page which is hosted by the board, from this dashboard you will be able to:

* [Configure Wi-Fi](#connecting-to-your-wi-fi)
* [Register the factory (OTA)](#registering-a-factory)
* Board details
* Shell

## Connecting to Your Wi-Fi

Click the Wi-Fi button to start configuring your network connection.

![Select wifi on set up page](assets/x8-oob-main-wifi.png)

Select your Wi-Fi SSID.

Type the password.

Once its connected you should see the Wi-Fi status dot in the bottom left turn green.

***You can change your network by clicking on the button again and repeat the steps***

## Registering a Factory

Click the "Register with Factory" button.

![Register with factory](assets/x8-oob-main-factory.png)

And set your new factory name.

![Name your factory](assets/x8-oob-factory-name.png)

Click register, now you will get a code that you need to paste into your factory page by opening [Arduino Create Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc) in your browser and click the "Portenta X8 Board Manager" inside the integrations section.

## Controlling Portenta X8 Through the Terminal

You have plenty of ways to communicate with your board, be it wirelessly or with a cable. Next we are going to show how to use adb and ssh.

### ADB

First of all make sure you have the latest **Mbed OS Portenta Core**, which contains the adb program.

You can go to its directory inside the **Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/adb/32.0.0**. To check the tool you can use your terminal and type `adb`, you should get feedback from the tool when typing this.

To know the list of devices that can be accessed type `adb devices`.

If you only see one device you can try and type `adb shell`, you are now communicating with your Portenta X8.

### SSH

SSH is commonly used for remote control on different kinds of devices running different set ups through TCP-IP.

To communicate with your board, you will need to know the IP of it, and just type `ssh fio@<IP>`, then the terminal workaround should be the same as ADB. The password is `fio`.

![SSH connection](assets/ssh-connection.png)

As it is a linux device, you can do normal stuff like creating files, changing directory, etc.

To gain admin (root) access, type `sudo su -` and the password is `fio`  after that the terminal prefix should turn red.

### Inspecting Real Time Tasks

Run: `journalctl -f` to see what's going on on the device

## Uploading an Arduino Sketch

Make sure you have the latest mbed Core and as every other board you can select the board inside the `mbed Portenta`.

![Board selected in Arduino IDE](assets/IDE-boards.png)

And click compile and upload.

***Make sure you don't share GPIOs on the linux side and the Arduino sketch, this will avoid possible errors.***
